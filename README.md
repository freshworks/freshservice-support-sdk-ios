# Freshservice Support SDK

Freshservice Support SDK helps in the integration of the Freshservice support features within your in-house iOS mobile application.

The Freshservice Support SDK provides on-the-go access to some key support features of the Freshservice IT Service Management (ITSM) platform. Users (employees or requesters in your organization) can access specific support-related features from your in-house iOS mobile application, such as raising issues, viewing open tickets, and requesting services.
